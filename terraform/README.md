# Provisioning the verification server

This is a set of Terraform configurations which create the required
infrastructure for a verification server on Google Cloud. Please note that
**Terraform is only used for the initial deployment and provisioning of
underlying infrastructure!** It is not used for continuous delivery or
continuous deployment.

## Requirements

-   Terraform 0.13.1
    [Installation guide](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

-   firebase-cli. [Installation guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

-   gcloud. [Installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)

    Note: Make sure you **unset** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in your
    environment:

    ```text
    unset GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
    ```

## Instructions

1.  Create a GCP project.
    [Instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
    Enable a billing account for this project, and note its project ID (the
    unique, unchangeable string that you will be asked for during creation):

    ```text
    $ export PROJECT_ID="<value-from-above>"
    ```

1.  Authenticate to gcloud with:

    ```text
    $ gcloud auth login
    ```

    This will open a web browser. Choose the right Google account and click
    "allow".

    ```text
    $ gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    Set the quota project:

    ```text
    $ gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project "${PROJECT_ID}"
    ```

    This will open a web browser. Choose the right Google account and click
    "allow". Yes, this is nearly identical to the previous step.

    ```text
    $ firebase login
    ```

### Quick setup

This is for a POC. You should **not** use this method for production.

1.  Change into the `terraform/` directory. All future commands are run from the
    `terraform/` directory:

    ```text
    $ cd terraform/
    ```

1.  Save the project ID as a Terraform variable:

    ```text
    $ cat <<EOF > terraform.tfvars
      project = "${PROJECT_ID}"

      EOF
      ```

1.  Run `terraform init`. Terraform will automatically download the plugins
    required to execute this code. You only need to do this once per machine.

    ```text
    $ terraform init
    ```

1.  Execute Terraform:

    ```text
    $ terraform apply
    ```

1.  After the initial provision, go to the Firebase admin console and enable
    your desired login (Facebook, email/password, etc).

### Production setup

For a production setup, create a new repo and import these configurations as a
Terraform module.

1.  Create a Cloud Storage bucket for storing remote state. This is important if
    you plan to have multiple people running Terraform or collaborating.

    ```text
    $ gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} gs://${PROJECT_ID}-terraform
    ```

    It is also **strongly recommended** that you enable versioning of this
    bucket. That will enable you to access old versions of the Terraform state
    for disaster recovery.

    ```text
    $ gsutil versioning set on gs://${PROJECT_ID}-terraform
    ```

    You can also create a [lifecycle
    policy](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managing-lifecycles) to only
    keep recent versions.

1.  Create a new source control repository dedicated to managing infrastructure.
    This example assumes the repo is named `"en-infra"`.

1.  Create a definition to import this module inside your `"en-infra"` repo:

    ```text
    $ mkdir ${PROJECT_ID}
    ```

    ```text
    $ cat <<EOF > ${PROJECT_ID}/main.tf
      terraform {
        backend "gcs" {
          bucket = "${PROJECT_ID}-terraform"
        }
      }

      module "en" {
        source = "github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/terraform"

        project = var.project

        create_env_file = true

        service_environment = {
          server = {
            FIREBASE_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL   = "TODO"
            FIREBASE_TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL = "TODO"
          }

          stats-puller = {
            KEY_SERVER_URL = "https://example.com"
          }
        }
      }

      # Enable optional alerting.
      module "en-alerting" {
        source  = "github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/terraform/alerting"
          project = "example"

          adminapi_hosts  = ["adminapi.example.org"]
          apiserver_hosts = ["apiserver.example.org"]
          server_hosts    = ["example.org"]

          alert_on_human_accessed_secret = false
          alert_on_human_decrypted_value = false

          alert-notification-channel-non-paging = {
              email = {
                  labels = {
                      email_address = "nobody@example.com"
                  }
              }
          }
          alert-notification-channel-paging = {
              slack = {
                  labels = {
                      channel_name = "#foo"
                      auth_token   = "abr"
                  }
              }
          }
          depends_on = [module.en]
      }

      output "en" {
        value = module.en
      }
    EOF
    ```

    As shown above, all the variables defined in the Terraform are available as
    inputs/parameters to the module definition. See the `variables.tf` file for
    the full list of configuration options.

1.  (Optional if alerting is enabled): Manually create Google Cloud Monitoring
    workspace: Go to
    https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/signup?project=${PROJECT_ID}&nextPath=monitoring
    and create the first workspace for the project. NOTE: as of Sep 2020 this
    can only be done on Google Cloud Console.

1.  Run `terraform init`. Terraform will automatically download the plugins
    required to execute this code. You only need to do this once per machine.

    ```text
    $ terraform init
    ```

1.  Execute Terraform:

    ```text
    $ terraform apply
    ```

1.  After the initial provision, go to the Firebase admin console and enable
    your desired login (Facebook, email/password, etc).

1.  Moving forward, instruct Terraform to download new modules before you apply:

    ```text
    $ terraform get -update
    ```

    Then execute Terraform as normal. Note that without this command, you are
    "pinned" to the previous module version.

Terraform will create the required infrastructure including the database,
service accounts, keys, and secrets. **As a one-time operation**, Terraform will
also migrate the database schema and build/deploy the initial set of services on
Cloud Run. Terraform does not manage the lifecycle of those resources beyond
their initial creation.

### Migrating from quick to production

If you previously used the quick setup and want to migration to a production
setup, the process is somewhat meticulous. Since Terraform resources are keyed
off of their ID, you'll need to manually move the resource IDs using the
[`terraform state mv`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html#example-move-a-resource-into-a-module)
command.

1.  Update your configurations to import the configuration as a module using the
    instructions from the production setup above.

1.  List all of the current resources in your state:

    ```text
    $ terraform state list
    ```

1.  For each of those resources, run `terraform state mv`, prefixing their new
    value with `module.en`, for example:

    ```text
    $ terraform state mv thing.name module.en.thing.name
    ```

1.  Continue planning until you have no diff.

### Local development and testing example deployment

The default Terraform deployment is a production-ready, high traffic deployment.
For local development and testing, you may want to use a less powerful setup:

```hcl
# terraform/terraform.tfvars
project                  = "..."
database_tier            = "db-custom-1-3840"
database_disk_size_gb    = 16
database_max_connections = 256
```

### Debugging

#### Custom hosts

Using custom hosts (domains) for the services requires a manual step of updating
DNS entries. Run Terraform once and get the `lb_ip` entry. Then, update your DNS
provider to point the A records to that IP address. Give DNS time to propagate
and then re-apply Terraform. DNS must be working for the certificates to
provision.

#### Cannot find firebase provider

If you're getting an error like:

```text
To work with <resource> its original provider configuration at
provider["registry.terraform.io/-/google"] is required, but it has been removed.
This occurs when a provider configuration is removed while objects created by
that provider still exist in the state. Re-add the provider configuration to
destroy <resource>, after which you can remove the provider configuration again.
```

It means you're upgrading from an older Terraform configuration. Try the
following:

```text
$ terraform state rm google_project_iam_member.firebase
$ terraform state rm google_service_account.firebase
$ terraform state rm google_service_account_key.firebase
```

#### Firebase TOS Not Accepted

If you're getting an error like:

```text
Error: Error creating Project: googleapi: Error 403: Firebase Tos Not Accepted
```

It means the user hasn't accepted ToS(Terms of Services) of Firebase yet. Do:

1.  Open a browser, navigate to https://firebase.google.com
1.  Click `Add a project`, it will prompt Terms of Service agreement, agree
