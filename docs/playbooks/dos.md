# Cloud Armor DoS protection

During incident, if you want to block access from certain users (e.g.
bad behaving client, or malicious users), or access to certain resources
(e.g. server side vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed quickly
enough with a new release), you can utilize Cloud Armor to block the
traffic.

Please read the comments in [dos.tf](../../terraform/dos.tf) on how to
do that.
