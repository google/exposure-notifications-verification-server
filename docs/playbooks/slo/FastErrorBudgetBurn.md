# Fast Error Budget Alert

This alert fires when 2% of the error budget, as determined by the
availability SLO, is consumed in an hour.

Our SLO is defined in [slos.tf](../../../terraform/alerting/slos.tf).

The error budget start burning when 5xx error are returned.

## Triage steps

First thing first, communicate to the internal chat to raise awareness.

We currently have Error Burdget Burn SLO defined for the following services:
* `apiserver`
* `adminapi`
* `server`
* `enx-redirect`

Confirm which service is firing the alert by looking at the alert name. It should be in the format of `FastErrorBudgetBurn-SERVICE_NAME` or `SlowErrorBudgetBurn-SERVICE_NAME`.

Next, on Cloud Console you can click on the Navigation Menu -> `Monitoring` -> `Metrics Explorer`. 
Select `Query Editor` and  use the following Metrics Query Language (MQL) queries to see the 5xx errors:

```
fetch cloud_run_revision
| metric 'run.googleapis.com/request_count'
| filter (metric.response_code_class == '5xx')
| align rate(1m)
| every 1m
```

You have confirmed the system is having 500 errors, now you can go check the logs. 
To do so you have to click on Navigation Menu -> `Logging` -> `Logs Explorer`
Use the following log filter to determine what went wrong:

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="${SERVICE_NAME}"
severity=ERROR
```
You will find relevant error messages under the `jsonPayload` field. Assess the message to analyze what component of the system could be failing.
