Hello,

{{/* TODO(sethvargo): Pipe value from Realm */}}
The number of SMS errors for {{.Realm.Name}} in the past 24 hours is {{.Realm.TODO}}, which exceeds the typical value. This could indicate a problem with your Twilio configuration.

Consider reviewing the statistics page for {{.Realm.Name}} at {{.RootURL}}/realm/stats.

If you manage your own Twilio account, you can also review any logs in the Twilio console. If you are using a sponsored Twilio account, please contact your server operator for support.
